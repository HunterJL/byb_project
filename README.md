## byb_project

This is a project that shows a learner of python how to code and make the computer print "hello world". 
This is a fundamental example often taught in early Python tutorials and allows the teacher to communicate basic formatting, syntax, commands, etc.
If the user runs the code in VSCode or other IDE, then they will see the computer respond with the action of print the word "hello world".
A typical user of this code will be a Data Science lecturer or Computing educator who is trying to show the print() function within Python to a student.
